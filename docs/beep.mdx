# Hello Diana

I wonder if there's any serious
performance problems with the hot reloading.
This seems to have stopped reloading correctly.
Is this any better without the progress bar?

## Leia is a little silly billy

She likes to fuck around with the plant pot
Is the performance on this better
now that the state isn't rerendering everything?
